# Creative-Neural-Network
Using Unity and Pure Data,  connected by Kalimba

**Abstract:**

Neural networks are incredibly powerful tools that can be used to solve a multitude of problems. However, these problems are often ones with a correct answer, like image recognition and natural language processing. They are not as often used for creative generation, where there is no correct answer other than the composers' own judgements. This project pushes against this trend by using neural networks to generate live soundtracks for a video game as a user plays it, and continually retrains the network as the user makes more choices. Unity is used to build the video game and collect user input, which is then sent into neural network built in Pure Data, which also then generates and outputs the live soundtrack. This system can create a large variety of cohesive yet unique compositions to enhance the gameplay experience. This will hopefully represent a first step in a future with fully customized gameplay experiences, both artistically and methodologically.
